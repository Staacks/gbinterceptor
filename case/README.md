# GB Interceptor Case

These are various resources and design files for cases for the GB Interceptor. The 3d-printed one referenced in the Youtube videos and the build guide [build guide](https://github.com/Staacks/gbinterceptor/wiki/Build-guide) can be found in the folder 3dprint. Others have been contributed by users and are mentioned below.

The easiest way to pick the right case for yourself is probably by looking at the [case guides](https://github.com/Staacks/gbinterceptor/wiki#case-options) on the Wiki.

# Important note about the break-out extension board

If you want to create a custom case using the extension board to place the cartridge slot in a more flexible manner, please take special care to correctly match the pins. For this, ignore the silklayer (printing) ob the PCB and look at the position of pin one, which is the one with the square pad (the others are circular). The printed outline on the PCB may work fine for jumper wires or special connectors, but with the normal ribbon cable connectors (known from old disk drives) the pin headers of either the extension board or the GB Interceptor need to be soldered onto the opposite side of the board in order for the pins to match. Therefore, keep track of pin one when creating your own solution.

# Folder list

Please, find details about each option in the [case guides](https://github.com/Staacks/gbinterceptor/wiki#case-options) on the Wiki.

* __3dprint__  
  The original 3d printed case as discussed in the videos.
* __3dprint-angryhelder__  
  Variant by AngryHelder (Helder Silva) of the original 3d printed case. These are step files derived from the original 3dprint case to allow for easy adaption into new case projects. It also includes a version that is easier and nicer to print but requires glueing.
